1,Abyssinian,This is a medium-size cat weighing 6 to 10 pounds,9 to 15 years,/assets/images/abyssinian1.jpeg,/assets/images/abyssinian2.jpeg,/assets/images/abyssinian3.jpeg,"<p>Showing cats was all the rage in the late Victorian era. One of the unusual breeds exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871 was an Abyssinian captured in the late Abyssinian War who took third place. The report on the cat show, published in the January 27, 1872, issue of Harper's Weekly, was the first known mention in print of the breed. Unfortunately, no records exist regarding the cats origins, although myths and speculation abound, including claims that it was the cat of the pharaohs, and that it was created in Britain by crossing silver and brown tabbies with cats that had ticked coats. Today, genetic evidence suggests that the cats came from Indian Ocean coastal regions and parts of Southeast Asia. British and Dutch traders may well have brought the cats from ports such as Calcutta, India, or the islands of Indonesia.</p><br><p> A taxidermied specimen of a ruddy ticked cat exhibited in the 1830s at the Leiden Zoological Museum in The Netherlands, where he was labeled Patrie, domestica India, gives creedence to that theory. The cats were probably given the name Abyssinian because Zula, the cat exhibited at the Crystal Palace, was said to have been imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Early pedigrees show crosses to non-Abyssinian cats, which may explain the introduction of new coat colors and the gene for long hair. American cat fanciers first imported some Abyssinians in 1900, but Abyssinian breeding programs didn't get a real start in the United States until the 1930s, when more of the cats were imported from Britain. It's a good thing that a number of cats were exported to the U.S. because World War II devastated the breed. Only a dozen of the cats had survived in England by the end of the war. The breed bounced back, however, and has become one of the most popular cat breeds.</p>","<p>Of all the cat breeds, the Abyssinian is perhaps the one who lives life to the fullest. He climbs higher, jumps farther, plays harder. Nothing escapes the notice of this highly intelligent and inquisitive cat, a quality that makes life with him both endlessly entertaining and continuously challenging. Staying a step ahead of an Aby, as the breed is nicknamed, or even just keeping pace with him, requires the fancy footwork of a Fred Astaire, the brainpower of an Einstein and a sense of humor that never stops. You never know what he'll get into next, although you can assume that if you have something or are doing something, your Aby will want to investigate it closely. Some people refer to the cats as 'Aby-grabbys' because of their propensity for taking things that catch their interest. Sometimes it may seem as if the Aby never sleeps. He is ever in motion, jumping up in the window to look at birds or squirrels, leaping on top of the refrigerator to supervise meal preparation, perching on your desk to watch your fingers move over the keyboard and then swiping at them so you'll pay attention to him instead. </p><br><p>This is a playful, persistent cat who adores being the center of attention and will do anything to achieve and maintain that status. The Aby loves to play, so plan on making or purchasing a variety of toys to keep him occupied. Ping-Pong balls, bottle caps, wadded-up pieces of paper, puzzle toys and teasers such as big peacock feathers will all amuse this busy and brainy cat. Teach him to retrieve at your peril. Once you start, he won't let you stop. He learns tricks quickly and many Abys enjoy running a feline agility course. A love of heights is a signal trait of the Abyssinian. He likes to be as high up as possible and will appreciate having one or more ceiling-height cat trees. When those arent available, he is perfectly capable of making his way to the uppermost point of any room. Fortunately, he is naturally graceful and rarely breaks items unless it is simply out of curiosity.</p><br><p>Abys are adaptable throughout their lives and fit well into any home where they are loved and given plenty of attention. In a home where people are at work or school during the day, the Aby does best with a companion, ideally another Aby, who can match his activity level. If left to his own devices, the Aby may well dismantle the house in his search for something interesting to do. Beware! The Aby can be addictive. Once you've had one, you may find that no other cat will do. </p>","<p>The short, fine coat of the Abyssinian is easily cared for with weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. A bath when the cat is shedding will help to remove excess hair more quickly. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don't run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.</p><br><p> Keep the litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a dirty box may cause them to start using other places in the house instead. It's a good idea to keep an Abyssinian as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Abyssinians who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.</p>","<p>The active and social Abyssinian is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. He's smart enough to get out of the way of toddlers but loves school-age children because they are a match for his energy level and curiosity. Nothing scares him, certainly not dogs, and he will happily make friends with them if they don't give him any trouble. Abys have also been known to get along with large parrots, ferrets and other animals. Always introduce any pets, even other cats, slowly and in a controlled setting.</p>","<p>Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature.

2,American Bobtail,The American Bobtail typically weighs 8 to 13 pounds.,11 to 15 years,/assets/images/americanBobtail1.jpeg,/assets/images/americanBobtail2.jpeg,/assets/images/americanBobtail3.jpeg,"<p>Bobtailed cats, the result of a natural genetic mutation that causes a shortened tail, have appeared in various places over the centuries, from Japan to the Isle of Man. Sometimes they get noticed by the right people, and voila! A new breed is born. Such was the case with the American Bobtail, which descends from a short-tailed-kitten acquired by John and Brenda Sanders during a vacation to Arizona. They named him Yodi, and he became the father of the breed in the swinging 60s when he had his way with the Sanders female, Mishi, once they arrived back home in Iowa.</p><br><p>Yodi and Mishi'skittens had short tails, too, a clue that the trait was caused by a dominant gene. Family friend Mindy Shoultz, who'd had experience breeding Persians, partnered with Charlotte Bentley to develop the unusual cats into a breed. They bred the kittens to other cats with naturally short tails that were found in various places throughout the United States and Canada. They selectively bred the cats to be big and sturdy with a wild look but a sweet temper. All of the cats used to develop the breed were non-pedigreed domestic shorthairs and longhairs. Now, after 50 years, such outcrossing is no longer necessary because now the cats have pedigrees longer than their tails.</p><br><p>The International Cat Association accepted the American Bobtail into its new breed category in 1989 and gave it full recognition in 2002. The American Bobtail is also recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association and the American Cat Fanciers Association.</p>","<p>Let's say you love the Golden Retriever's personality, but his size and energy level are a bit more than you can handle. American Bobtail lovers say you should take a look at their cat instead. He's a lover with a heart of gold who is devoted to his people, follows them around, loves to play, walks nicely on a leash (after training, of course), and welcomes guests with a smile.</p><br><p>This is a smart cat who enjoys puzzle toys, learning tricks, and playing fetch. He isn't as vocal as some breeds, but he communicates his pleasure with chirps, clicks and trills, as well as the standard purr and meow.</p><br><p>The American Bobtail has an adaptable nature, so he's a good traveler. Long-distance truckers and Rvers find him to be an excellent companion. The cats have also found a niche with some psychotherapists because of their loving and intuitive nature. That same adaptability and kindness makes him a good family companion and suited to a variety of lifestyles, from relaxed to rowdy.<p>","<p>The American Bobtail's coat doesn't usually mat or tangle as long as you comb or brush it a couple of times a week. You may notice that the cat sheds more in the spring and fall, so it can be a good idea to groom him more frequently during those times.

3,American Curl,"The American Curl is a small cat, weighing 5 to 10 pounds.",12 to 16 years,/assets/images/americanCurl1.jpeg,/assets/images/americanCurl2.jpeg,/assets/images/americanCurl3.jpeg,"<p>The American Curl is one of the youngest cat breeds. It was born of a natural genetic mutation that first appeared in Shulamith, a stray black kitten with long, silky hair and, strangely, ears that curled backward. She found her way to the welcoming door of Joe and Grace Ruga in Lakewood, California. The Rugas named her Shulamith after the "black and comely" princess in the Old Testament book the Song of Solomon.</p><br><p>Shulamith had a litter of four kittens by an unknown father, and two of them shared her curly ears. A consultation with a geneticist showed that the trait was caused by a dominant gene. Cat fanciers began selectively breeding the cats in 1983, and the new breed, named the American Curl, began to be registered by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1986. They were recognized by The International Cat Association in 1987 and achieved full recognition from CFA in 1993. With almost unheard-of rapidity, the trip from stray to pedigreed breed took only six years. The breed also stands out for being the first single breed with two coat lengths recognized by CFA.</p><br><p>All American Curls are descended from Shulamith. The cats can be bred to other Curls or outcrossed to non-pedigreed domestic cats with straight ears that otherwise meet the Curl breed standard. This helps to ensure a large gene pool and genetic diversity. Straight-eared kittens from American Curl litters can be used in breeding programs or placed as pets.</p>","<p>The friendly and gentle American Curl is known for his people-loving personality. He even likes children, which is not always the case with cats, and has been known to seek out their company. True to to his domestic shorthair heritage, he is moderately active, curious and smart. He is likely to follow you around to see what you’re doing, but he’s not talkative or bossy like some breeds. If need be, he will quietly petition you for attention, food or whatever else he wants. When you come home from work, he will gladly greet you with a head bump and may even extend the affectionate gesture to guests in the home.</p><br><p>American Curls are often called the "Peter Pan" of the cat world. It is not unusual to see older Curls flying through the house with just as much joy as younger ones. Males and females are equally active.</p><br><p>The Curl likes to play and can learn to fetch. He’s also capable of opening doorknobs, so be careful what you put away in any cabinets that are within his reach. When he’s ready for a break, he will happily settle into a lap. He is alert and adaptable, well suited to any home or family who will love him.</p>","<p>The Curl’s coat can be short or long, and both lengths are easy to care for. The longhaired variety has little undercoat, so it’s unlikely to mat or tangle. A weekly combing is plenty to keep the longhaired or shorthaired Curl looking beautiful. Try running the comb backwards through the shorthair’s coat; it can help to remove any dead hair that has accumulated. Shorthairs shed year-round and tend to shed more than the longhairs. During warm months, when the longhairs may shed more heavily, it’s a good idea to brush or comb more often. A bath is rarely necessary.</p><br><p>Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease.

Their ratting abilities made cats valued members of ships’ crews, and they may well have made their way to the New World even earlier, on ships that carried settlers to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, Spanish explorers to Florida and Vikings to Newfoundland. Some of the descendants of those seafaring cats, known prosaically as shorthairs, or domestic shorthairs, became what we know today as American Shorthairs.</p><br><p>Cats were valued on land as well as at sea. Farmers, shopkeepers and householders all needed a good cat to protect their stores of food from mice, rats and other vermin. The shorthairs were solid, hardy working stock, well suited to the tough conditions that prevailed on the untamed continent. Such good hunters were they that a publication from 1634 credits them with saving a New England colony’s crops from squirrels and chipmunks. From their coastal arrival points, they went west with settlers, and thrived.</p><br><p>By 1895, shorthairs had made enough of a mark that they were exhibited at the first cat show in the United States. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized them as a breed in 1906. To differentiate them from randombred cats, also known as domestic shorthairs, the pedigreed felines were given the name American Shorthair in 1966. The cats are recognized by all registries.</p>","<p>The adaptable and good-natured American Shorthair retains his hunting ability, but these days he is more likely to be a family companion, a job at which he excels.

It’s not unusual for natural mutations to pop up in cats in different places around the world, but so far the mutation for a wiry coat has appeared only in the United States. It was first seen in 1966, in a litter of kittens born to a domestic shorthair cat in upstate New York. The only kitten to survive from that litter was a red tabby and white male. Because of his unusual coat, the owners showed him to a local cat breeder, Joan O’Shea, who purchased the kinky-coated kitten for $50, named him Council Rock Adam of Hi-Fi and set about trying to reproduce him through crosses to American Shorthairs.</p><br><p>The American Wirehair achieved full recognition from the Cat Fanciers Association in 1978.

It is unknown whether the long hair is the result of a natural mutation or a cross between the Siamese and a longhaired breed such as a Persian or Turkish Angora. Although longhaired Siamese appeared earlier, the cats did not begin to be developed as a breed until the 1940s and 1950s. The Cat Fanciers Federation recognized the Balinese in 1961, followed by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1970.

Balinese can be outcrossed to Javanese, Siamese, Colorpoint Shorthairs and Oriental Longhairs.</p>","<p>The Siamese and the Balinese might differ in coat length, but beneath the skin they are identical. Balinese are extremely fond of their people. They like to be "helpful" and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Balinese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. He is frequently underfoot, so he might not be the best choice for people who are unsteady on their feet or use a walker or cane. A Balinese is perhaps not quite as loud as his relative the Siamese, but he is most definitely just as opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. You can also count on him to "tell all" to visitors, so be grateful that most people are not conversant in the Balinese language. The Balinese is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb.

7,Bengal ,Bengals are large cats and weigh 8 to 15 pounds or more.,10 to 16 years,/assets/images/bengal1.jpg,/assets/images/bengal2.jpeg,/assets/images/bengal3.jpg,“<p>With his distinctive spotted coat and large size, the Bengal looks like a wild cat on the prowl, but although one of his ancestors is the small, wild Asian leopard cat, he’s a domestic cat through and through. Bengals take their name from the Asian leopard cat’s scientific name, Felis bengalensis. They were created through crosses between an Asian leopard cat — which in the 1950s and into the 1960s could be purchased at pet stores — and domestic shorthairs. Jean Mill, a breeder in California, was the first to make such a cross, but not because she wanted to create a new breed. She had acquired a leopard cat and allowed her to keep company with a black tom cat so she wouldn’t be lonely. To her surprise, since she hadn’t thought the two species would mate, kittens resulted, and Mill kept a spotted female. Breeding her back to her father produced a litter of spotted and solid kittens.</p><br><p> At about the same time, Dr. Willard Centerwall was crossing Asian leopard cats with domestic cats at Loyola University. The leopard cats were resistant to the feline leukemia virus, so researchers were interested in finding out if the trait could be passed on to hybrid offspring. Various breeders became interested in developing the cats as a breed. Mill was one of them. Changes in her life had caused her to give up cat breeding, but she was ready to begin again. She had acquired some of Dr. Centerwall’s hybrids and sought out suitable males to breed to them. One was an orange domestic shorthair that she found in India, of all places, and the other was a brown spotted tabby acquired from a shelter.</p><br><p> Bengals today are considered to be one and the same with domestic cats, and any Bengal purchased should be at least four generations removed from any ancestors with wild bloodlines. The first cat association to recognize the Bengal was The International Cat Association, which granted the breed experimental status in 1983, followed by full recognition in 1991. The Bengal is also recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association and the United Feline Organization. Bengal cats are so sought after, that a British woman paid over $50,000 for her bengal cat in 1990, dubbing them the "Rolls Royce" of feline companions.</p>”,“<p>The Bengal is highly active and highly intelligent. This makes him fun to live with, but he can sometimes be challenging. On the whole, the Bengal is a confident, talkative, friendly cat who is always alert. Nothing escapes his notice. He likes to play games, including fetch, and he’s a whiz at learning tricks. His nimble paws are almost as good as hands, and it’s a good thing he doesn’t have opposable thumbs or he would probably rule the world. Bored bengal cats can also adopt some unconventional (and slightly destructive) habits, including: turning light switches on and off, fishing seals out of drains and excitedly plucking CDs from your DVD player.Fond of playing in water, the Bengal is not above jumping into the tub or strolling into the shower with you.</p><br><p> Aquarium and pond fish may be at risk from his clever paws. He also loves to climb and can often be found perching at the highest point he can reach in the home. A tall cat tree or two is a must for this feline, as are puzzle toys that will challenge his intelligence. On the rare occasions that he isn’t swinging on chandeliers or swimming in your pool, the affectionate Bengal will be pleased to sit on your lap. It goes without saying that he will share your bed. And yes, he steals the covers.</p>”,“<p>The short, thick coat of the Bengal is easily cared for with weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. A bath is rarely necessary.

Keep the litter box spotlessly clean.</p><br><p> Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a dirty box may cause them to start using other places in the house instead. It’s a good idea to keep a Bengal as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Keeping him indoors also protects local birds and wildlife from this avid hunter. If possible, build your Bengal a large outdoor enclosure where he can jump and climb safely. Bengals who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.</p>”,“<p>The active and social Bengal is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. He’s smart enough to get out of the way of toddlers but loves school-age children because they are a match for his energy level and curiosity. Nothing scares him, certainly not dogs, and he will happily make friends with them if they don’t give him any trouble. Always introduce any pets, even other cats, slowly and in a controlled setting. Like many active cats, bengals have a high prey drive and should not be trusted with smaller prey animals such as: hamsters, smaller rabbits and guinea pigs.</p>",“<p>Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Bengals are generally healthy, but the following diseases have been seen in the breed. 1) Flat-chested kitten syndrome, a deformity that can range from mild to severe. Kittens who survive to adulthood usually show no signs once they reach maturity. 2) Hip dysplasia, which in severe cases can cause lameness</p>”
